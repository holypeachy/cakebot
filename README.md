# üç∞ CakeBot
A friend was starting a discord server and I wanted to make a custom bot for it. I add features based on what my friend wants and things I think would be neat to have.  
> üôè Huge thanks to [Krayon](https://github.com/lcsabi) for contributing from time to time, and for always helping me when I'm stuck with python or some issue I can't solve. I promise I'll learn to use a proper commit naming scheme soon.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This bot has a few NSFW (18+) commands, do not use them if you are a minor.  

## Important Notes:
- For those who want to fork the code [click here](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot#for-reference-here-are-all-the-apis-im-currently-using).
- For OAuth2 / Bot Permissions [click here](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot#OAuth2).
- Keep in mind that this is a work in progress. The main branch is the "production" branch, the code here should be mostly bug free. If there is a bug it will quickly be caught because my bot is always running.  
- Even though the bot was only intended for 1 Discord server, it is written to support multiple servers.
- Every update that a property is added to the Server class, the bot will break and not start. You'll have to manually add the key and a value to the json file for it to load. I need to fix this soon because it has become quite a nuisance.

## Features (As of October 2, 2023)
For information on how some of these features can be modified read through the [commands list](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot#commands).

## Developer Commands
- dev_shutdown
- dev_saveservers

## Notes for anyone who wants to fork the code:
First I would like to apologize for the current state of this code base, the bot has grown quite a bit (as of writing this: 1300 lines) and I am yet to take steps to organize the code into separate files. Although I think you'll find that it is well organized.
- The major script is newbot.py not bot.py, the latter is depricated.
- Make sure to create a servers.json and a config.py. Add the following content to the config.py:
```
TOKEN = 'your_token_here' # Discord Bot's token
COMMAND_PREFIX = '!' # The prefix for the bot's commands
RAPIAPI_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
```
- We use poetry to handle dependecies (thanks Krayon for letting me know this exists):
  - ```pip install poetry```
  - Then, in the project run ```poetry install``` to install all required dependencies.
- The way I determine if someone is an admin is if they can manage channels.
- I use RapiAPI for all APIs and all of the ones I use are free. So if you want to use the bot you can go to the [site](https://rapidapi.com/) and subscribe to all the APIs I used here, which you'll see in the beginning of the newbot.py script.
- The testing scripts contain some code I'm experimenting with. As of writing this, testing.py contains the beginnings of a music playing functionality (the file itself is its own standalone bot). testing2.py is where I test the APIs.

### For reference, here are all the APIs I'm currently using

## OAuth2
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to move the CakeBot role higher in the role list than the miscellaneous roles (age, games, etc.) because role select will not work properly.  

Here are all the permission the bot will need:
