# üç∞ CakeBot
A friend was starting a discord server and I wanted to make a custom bot for it. I add features based on what my friend wants and things I think would be neat to have.  
> üôè Huge thanks to [Krayon](https://github.com/lcsabi) for contributing from time to time, and for always helping me when I'm stuck with python or some issue I can't solve. I promise I'll learn to use a proper commit naming scheme soon.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This bot has a few NSFW (18+) commands, do not use if you are a minor.  

## Important Notes:
- For those who want to fork the code [click here](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot#for-reference-here-are-all-the-apis-im-currently-using).
- Keep in mind that this is a work in progress. The main branch is the "production" branch, the code here should be mostly bug free. If there is a bug it will quickly be caught because my bot is always running.  
- Even though the bot was only intended for 1 Discord server, it is written to support multiple servers.
- Every update that a property is added to the Server class, the bot will break and not start. You'll have to manually add the key and a value to the json file for it to load. I need to fix this soon because it has become quite a nuisance.

## Features (As of October 2, 2023)
For information on how some of these features can be modified read through the [commands list](https://github.com/holypeachy/cakebot#commands).
### Fun

  - "hi cake" or "hello cake"

## Developer Commands

## Notes for anyone who wants to fork the code:
First I would like to apologize for the current state of this code base, the bot has grown quite a bit (as of writing this: 1300 lines) and I am yet to take steps to organize the code into separate files. Although I think you'll find that it is well organized.
- The major script is newbot.py not bot.py, the latter is depricated.
- The way I determine if someone is an admin is if they can manage channels.
- I use RapiAPI for all APIs and all of the ones I use are free. So if you want to use the bot you can go to the [site](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis) and subscribe to all the APIs I used here, which you'll see in the beginning of the newbot.py script.
- The testing scripts contain some code I'm experimenting with. As of writing this, testing.py contains the beginnings of a music playing functionality (the file itself is its own standalone bot). testing2.py is where I test the APIs.

### For reference, here are all the APIs I'm currently using
